                        <h2> Reasons Why I Love Food! </h2>
                        <h3> Read time: 5 mins </h3>
                    </header> 
                    <main>
                        <p>I've always loved to eat. For as long as I can remember I have enjoyed food. Perhaps it's due to my mother being the world's best cook, or maybe it's my natural inclination towards the variety of tastes and flavours that the world and its many countries have to offer. Whatever the reason, I'm a foodie through and through (period). This article is going to explore just a few of the reasons why food makes me happy, otherwise we could be here all day...</p> 
                        <br>

                        <h3> 1. THE TASTE </h3>
                        <p> First of all, it tastes so good! Now, of course, food is needed to sustain life but, when it's seasoned impeccably, there's nothing quite like it! I can't imagine anything worse than being hungry and being served (or cooking up) a bland meal... DEAD. No, not for me. During school, I used to collect and carry around salt, pepper, and ketchup sachets in my blazer pocket just in case the canteen food was not doing what it was meant to do. Take notes and come prepared!</p> 
                        <p> At this point I might as well add that the smell contributes to the level of desire I feel when confronted with a plate of food... Like a prospective suitor, it's gotta smell good!</p>
                       
                        <h3> 2. THE LOOK </h3>
                        <p>Now, this is not so important to people when it comes to food. As I've already mentioned, food is needed for sustenance, and for some, that's all it is. However, for me, this is only a small fraction of the experience. I do enjoy making my food presentable, even at home. I will admit, this is a bigger point of contention when it comes to eating out - the food MUST look delicious at a restaurant because duh!</p>

                        <h3> 3. THE POSSIBILITIES </h3>
                        <p> Food can come to you by many different means. Whether you whip up the culinary masterpiece in your kitchen or dine out at the fanciest restaurant in central London, the options for obtaining food are endless. Even on a lazy night in, one can quickly open Deliveroo or Ubereats and have their dish delivered within 20 mintues; technology these days! This access to food is a blessing and we must be grateful for it, especially living in a first-world country. </p>

                        <h3> 4. THE VIBES </h3>
                        <p> The final point I want to make has to do, not with the food itself, but with how one can enjoy said food. This must be the final point or, as I mentioned before, I could go on forever. Last, but not least, is the vibes.</p> 
                        <p> Lighting, seating, entertainment, and music can and definitely will contribute to the comfort one experiences when one eats. When eating out, I believe the careful combination of these factors is more important, as, of course, you are paying for the overall experience and not just the food. However, if you have access to mood lighting, a soft sofa, and a great movie or series ready to watch on the TV or laptop, your dining experience can be just as fun at home as it would be out and about!</p>
